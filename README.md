# spring-eureka-client
Eureka Client

Before registering, I was using it with 
http://localhost:8181/client/test
After registering it can be accessed with following url
http://192.168.1.113:8181/client/test

service will be registered with CAPITAL NAME as mentioned in resource -> application.properties file

In my case it's client-service
Service registered will be CLIENT-SERVICE
